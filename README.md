# DHIS2 Public Portal

-   A minimal working PoC for a more secure Public Portal for visualization of DHIS2 data, leveraging the new Next.js Server Actions implement authentication to the middleware via an API Key that is securely stored by the Next.js app in an environment variable and referenced by the Server Action ('use server) code without exposing the key to the client.
